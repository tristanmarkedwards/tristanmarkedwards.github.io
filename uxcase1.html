						<h3>BACKGROUND & OVERVIEW</h3>
					</div>
					
					<br>
					<p style="width: 100%">
						Eccommerce merchants and marketeers are often being held back from having more product sale conversions by utilising inferior quality data feeds, and while many are generally aware the problem exists, they often don't know how or where to take action.
					</p>

					<br>
					<p style="width: 100%">
						WakeupData is a startup IT company based in Aarhus, Denmark which specialises in optimising data feeds for Google Shopping Ads, Facebook Dynamic Ads, Amazon, and hundreds of other channels. Their ultimate goal is to improve customers ROI (return on investment) by increasing the visbility of their products in online stores.
						
					</p>

					<br>
					<p>
						Their customers have ranged from sole traders all the way up to large conglomerates like Salling Group, in a variety of industries - from fashion & apparel, to outdoors gear, to supermarket & household goods.

				<h3>THE PROBLEM</h3>
			</div>
			<br>
			
			<p style="width: 100%">
				The company's web-based WakeupData Hub allows customers to control their data feeds centrally and deploy variations to different channels, but a complication was idenitified by the Chief Technical Officer (CTO). 
				Essentially, because WakeupData Hub supports data feeds of various formats and purposes, their was no means to give the user detailed insights into what changes specifically would improve their data quality - a key ingredient in improving various business metrics, such as click through rate, and ultimately product sales.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				We were also aware from previous customer interviews that while WakeupData Hub could do many things, some users desired to have a leaner, more feature specific solution, preferably also at a cheaper price point.
			
				The challenge therefore was to try and create a new service that could offer value independent of the existing Hub service, with the possibility of being able to upsell to existing Hub customers and offer potentially greater value.

				With <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/last-e-commerce-duel-between-amazon-google-faisal-masud/">Google Shopping feeds controlling 28.9% of the market in 2020</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/last-e-commerce-duel-between-amazon-google-faisal-masud/">Amazon trailing in second with a 10.3% share</a>, the CTO decided that the ideal technical solution was to build an application that specifically catered to Google Shopping feeds. This would provide the flexibility required to give users specific, well informed suggestions on what changes to make to their data feeds. This would significantly reduce the barrier of entry for users to intervene with their own data and remove a reliance of some customers on WakeupData's Customer Success manager's to micromanage their feeds no their behalf - a significant operational cost.

				<h3>HIGH LEVEL PROPOSAL</h3>
			</div>
			
			<br>
			
			<p>
				After the initial customer interview round, myself and the CTO began throwing around ideas for a 'sister' application that could potentially work in tandem with WakeupData Hub. The controlling concept was that this sister app would give the customer very specific suggestions on what they could change to the product data in their data feed to improve search performance.
				The technical trade off being, that in order to give precise suggestions, the data type would have to be consistent, meaning the suggestions would be based against Google Shopping feeds (who had a 31.6% market share at the end of 2019) specifically.

				Our new CEO at the time had also suggested that we explore the possibility of using a different branding for the product, as it did not neccessarily have to be sold in conjunction with WakeupData Hub. After a product naming competition, the team settled on 'WiseMetrics'.

				<h3>DESIGN</h3>
			</div>
			<br>

			<p>
				In trying to get a feel for the product, I produced several logo variations, including 
				With the intial research completed and the high level proposal for a technical solution out of the way, it was time for me to work with the engineers on a workflow for the application.
			</p>
			<br>

			<div class="ux2-workflow-container">
				<img class="wm-logos" src="assets/ux1/wisemetrics-logos.jpg">
			</div>
			
			<br>
			<br>

			<p>
				With the theme of it being a 'sister application', I wanted to try and make a connection to the design I'd earlier produce for WakeupData Hub, by laying out core components (eg. header, breadcrumb trail, sub-navigation, user setting controls) in similar or the same locations.
			</p>

			<div class="ux1-workflow-container">

					My initial wireframe design for the 'suggestions' page of WiseMetrics. This was forseen to be the page the user would see on every visit, and how they would start their workflow.

				<img class="ux1-workflow-example" src="assets/ux1/wm-3.png" style="max-width: 564px;">
				<br>

					A higher fidelity mockup of the 'suggestions' page, as it would be seen on a tablet device - the decidedly lowest supported resolution device. I used a combination of Google Analytics and UserStory data from our existing Hub userbase to look at what devices our customers used, and was surprised to find a high number of tablet users performing complex tasks.

				</div>
				<br>
				<p>
					I reached out to a number of our customers who have frequent and lengthy user sessions (as identified on UserStory) to see if they'd be willing to participate in a guerilla usability testing session. I wanted them to undertake a quick 5 step process to see if they could successfully complete a common workflow - 'making a change to a product with a highlighted issue'. 
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					The testing session was largely successful in proving the flow was inituitive, but a frequent point that came up in communication with the users was some general mistaking and confusion about our two products.

				I figured, what if we presented the applications as more of a 'yin and yan'? One with a top navigation, the other a side navigation. Perhaps even different colour palette approaches - soft colours vs high contrast colours, full-size logo vs iconised logo, a more conventional layout vs more dynamic. This fed also into the concept of building a separate brand from the already established WakeupData.
