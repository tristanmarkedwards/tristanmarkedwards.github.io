            <p>
                Eccommerce merchants and marketeers are being held back by their own product feeds, and while many are generally aware the problem exists, they often don't know how or where to take action.

						While they may do their own online shopping as a customer as well, their primary interest is improving the visibility of their own product listings to improve sales. They may have more than one sales category, ranging from clothes, to electronics, to books, and beyond.

				<h3>USER CHALLENGES</h3>

            <p>
                In order to do some initial research, I did a series of interviews with some of WakeupData's existing customer base. The existing customers use their other eccommerce application, WakeupData Hub, that can deploy their data feeds to different channels (Shopify, Facebook, Google Shopping, etc)
            </p>

						<h3>HIGH LEVEL PROPOSAL</h3>
					</div>
					<br>
					<p>
						After the initial customer interview round, myself and the CTO began throwing around ideas for a 'sister' application that could potentially work in tandem with WakeupData Hub. The controlling concept was that this sister app would give the customer very specific suggestions on what they could change to the product data in their data feed to improve search performance.
						The technical trade off being, that in order to give precise suggestions, the data type would have to be consistent, meaning the suggestions would be based against Google Shopping feeds (who had a 31.6% market share at the end of 2019) specifically.
					</p>
					<br>

						<img class="ux2-rr3" src="assets/ux1/highlevelplan.png">
					</div>
					<br>

					<p>
						Our new CEO at the time had also suggested that we explore the possibility of using a different branding for the product, as it did not neccessarily have to be sold in conjunction with WakeupData Hub. After a product naming competition, the team settled on 'WiseMetrics'.

			<p>
				In trying to get a feel for the product, I produced several logo variations, including 
				With the intial research completed and the high level proposal for a technical solution out of the way, it was time for me to work with the engineers on a workflow for the application.

			<div class="ux2-workflow-container">

					I came up with the concept of a 'lobby' system, whereby a linesman can log into the service and find a list of open work tasks or 'jobs' needing to be completed. 
				</p>
				<br>
				<img class="rr-workflow" src="assets/ux2/rr-workflow.png">
				<br>
				<p>
					One of my goals for the system's design architecture was to create common UI components that would be reusable, regardless of the job type. I attempted to illustrate the workflow and how the interaction between universal and job specific UI elements would work.

			<p style="width: 100%">After showing the initial screen mockup to some of the users, I received a very important piece of feedback for the user experience:</p>

			<div style="display: flex; width: 100%; align-items: center; flex-direction: column; padding: 40px 0px;">
				<div>
					<div class="air-quote">
						<h4>'Can it be 'dark mode' by default? My eyes will get easily strained if I have to stare at the same bright interface all day.'</h4>
					</div>
					<img src="assets/quoteTriangle.png" style="position: absolute;">

			</div>

				<img src="assets/ux2/rr-1.png">
				<img src="assets/ux2/rr-2.png">
			</div>

			<br>
			<p>My revised 'dark' design was plauded for being easy to use, and I decided to design all of the job interfaces natively for a dark version. Initially I had considered doing both dark and light versions for each interface to give users a choice, but the value proposition didn't match the development overhead.</p>


			<p>I wanted to keep pushing the intuitivity of the application as a whole, and decided to program a custom animation system for the project in Unity, with easily reusable, chainable components, so that every user action would have a visual feedback to help them to understand what they need to do next:</p>

						Ergon was extremely happy with the scope of our solution. They were able to more than halve their time spent on annual campaigns and saved 7 million AUD annually in the process. 
						Fugro ROAMES was the successful at winning a tender for Essential Energy in New South Wales under very heavy competition to undertake similar work for their power network. The overall project outcome was considered a major success for Fugro ROAMES.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Fugro ROAMES also won additional contract work Fugro's Western Australia offices to implement a similar solution for the marine asset integrity industry. I was once again directly involved and created all the interfaces and flows for the new job types.
