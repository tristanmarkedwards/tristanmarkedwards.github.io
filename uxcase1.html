            <p>
                Eccommerce merchants and marketeers are being held back by their own product feeds, and while many are generally aware the problem exists, they often don't know how or where to take action.

				<h3>USER CHALLENGES</h3>

            <p>
                In order to do some initial research, I did a series of interviews with some of WakeupData's existing customer base. The existing customers use their other eccommerce application, WakeupData Hub, that can deploy their data feeds to different channels (Shopify, Facebook, Google Shopping, etc)
            </p>

						<h3>HIGH LEVEL PROPOSAL</h3>
					</div>
					<br>
					<p>
						After the initial customer interview round, myself and the CTO began throwing around ideas for a 'sister' application that could potentially work in tandem with WakeupData Hub. The controlling concept was that this sister app would give the customer very specific suggestions on what they could change to the product data in their data feed to improve search performance.
						The technical trade off being, that in order to give precise suggestions, the data type would have to be consistent, meaning the suggestions would be based against Google Shopping feeds (who had a 31.6% market share at the end of 2019) specifically.
					</p>
					<br>

					<div style="width: 100%; display: flex;	justify-content: center; padding: 20px 0px">
						<img class="ux2-rr3" src="assets/ux1/highlevelplan.png">
					</div>
					<br>

					<p>
						Our new CEO at the time had also suggested that we explore the possibility of using a different branding for the product, as it did not neccessarily have to be sold in conjunction with WakeupData Hub. After a product naming competition, the team settled on 'WiseMetrics'.

				<h3>DESIGN</h3>
			</div>
			<br>

			<p>
				In trying to get a feel for the product, I produced several logo variations, including 
				With the intial research completed and the high level proposal for a technical solution out of the way, it was time for me to work with the engineers on a workflow for the application.
			</p>
			<br>

			<div class="ux2-workflow-container">
				<img class="wm-logos" src="assets/ux1/wisemetrics-logos.jpg">
			</div>
			
			<br>
			<br>

			<p>
				With the theme of it being a 'sister application', I wanted to try and make a connection to the design I'd earlier produce for WakeupData Hub, by laying out core components (eg. header, breadcrumb trail, sub-navigation, user setting controls) in similar or the same locations.
			</p>

			<div class="ux1-workflow-container">
				<img class="ux1-workflow-example" src="assets/ux1/wm-5.jpg">

					My initial wireframe design for the 'suggestions' page of WiseMetrics. This was forseen to be the page the user would see on every visit, and how they would start their workflow.

				<br>
				<img class="ux1-workflow-example" src="assets/ux1/wm-3.jpg" style="max-width: 800px;">
				<br>
				<p>
					A higher fidelity mockup of the 'suggestions' page, as it would be seen on a tablet device - the decidedly lowest supported resolution device. I used a combination of Google Analytics and UserStory data from our existing Hub userbase to look at what devices our customers used, and was surprised to find a high number of tablet users performing complex tasks. 
				</p>
			</div>
			<br>
			<br>

			<img class="ux1-workflow-example" src="assets/ux1/usability-testing.png">
			<p>
				I reached out to a number of our customers who have frequent and lengthy user sessions (as identified on UserStory) to see if they'd be willing to participate in a guerilla usability testing session. I wanted them to undertake a quick 5 step process to see if they could successfully complete a common workflow - 'making a change to a product with a highlighted issue'. 
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				The testing session was largely successful in proving the flow was inituitive, but a frequent point that came up in communication with the users was some general mistaking and confusion about our two products.

			<p>
				It had occurred to me that the similarity between the interface layouts had created some unintended sense of ambiguity that might need to be addressed.

				I figured, what if we presented the applications as more of a 'yin and yan'? One with a top navigation, the other a side navigation. Perhaps even different colour palette approaches.

						Ergon was extremely happy with the scope of our solution. They were able to more than halve their time spent on annual campaigns and saved 7 million AUD annually in the process. 
						Fugro ROAMES was the successful at winning a tender for Essential Energy in New South Wales under very heavy competition to undertake similar work for their power network. The overall project outcome was considered a major success for Fugro ROAMES.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Fugro ROAMES also won additional contract work Fugro's Western Australia offices to implement a similar solution for the marine asset integrity industry. I was once again directly involved and created all the interfaces and flows for the new job types.
